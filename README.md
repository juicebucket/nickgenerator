Website version: 1.0.0. / Last Update: 17.06.2024

> [!NOTE]
> I implemented this website for myself back in 2020. However, it was implemented with a lot of errors and poor quality. Now, I decided to return to my idea and realize the website from scratch using new technologies. Unfortunately, the site is only available in Russian (maybe in the near future I will add English localization), as it was originally intended for the Russian-speaking audience.
